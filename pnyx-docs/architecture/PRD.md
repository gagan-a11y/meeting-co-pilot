# Meeting Co-Pilot — Product Requirements & Architecture Document

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: Dec 24, 2025
**Status**: Approved for Implementation

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem

Meetings suffer from two critical failures:

**Loss of Momentum During Meetings**
- Discussions stall when quick questions can't be answered
- Participants zone out and lose context
- Status updates consume time meant for decisions
- Unclear what's been decided vs still being discussed
- Cognitive overload leads to disengagement

**Loss of Context After Meetings**
- Decisions evaporate, notes are scattered and incomplete
- No clear summary of what was actually decided
- No reliable follow-up process, actions get lost
- Same topics resurface in future meetings

This creates confusion, repeated discussions, and stalled progress.

### Solution

**Meeting Co-Pilot**: A web-based collaborative meeting assistant that enhances efficiency during meetings and preserves context after.

**Key Capabilities**

**During Meeting** (Enhance Momentum & Efficiency)
- Live transcript visible to all — everyone stays on the same page
- Real-time Q&A — instant answers without derailing discussion
- "Catch me up" — zoned-out participants recover without interrupting
- Live decision/action tracking — clarity on what's decided vs open
- Current topic display — keeps discussion focused
- Cross-meeting context — "What did we decide last time?" answered instantly

**After Meeting** (Preserve Context)
- Automatic structured summary with decisions and actions
- Action items with owners and deadlines
- Searchable meeting history
- Continuity recaps for follow-up meetings

### Value Proposition

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Wait, what did we decide last time?" | Instant AI answer from past meeting context |
| "Can someone recap what I missed?" | "Catch me up" button → private summary |
| "What's our current churn rate?" | Real-time lookup during meeting via AI |
| "Did we decide that or just discuss it?" | Live decisions panel shows decided vs open |
| 30 min status updates before real discussion | Pre-loaded context, jump to decisions |
| Scattered notes, lost action items | Structured, searchable, tracked actions |

### Approach

Fork and extend **Meetily** (open-source, 7k+ GitHub stars) to add multi-participant sessions and real-time collaborative features. Remove desktop-specific components for a pure web experience suitable for on-site meetings (95% of use cases).

### Target Users

- **Junior Contributors** — Stay engaged, catch up when lost
- **Mid-Level Contributors** — Collaborate efficiently, clear actions
- **Managers/Leaders** — Facilitate effectively, track decisions

## 🛑 Reality vs Original Vision (Jan 2026 Audit)

**The Pivot:**
The original vision was a "Google Docs for Meetings" — multi-user, real-time sync, collaborative editing.
**The Reality:** We have built a **"Super-Powered Recorder"** — a single-host tool that records, transcribes, and provides AI assistance.

**Why the change?**
1.  **Technical Complexity:** Real-time multi-user state sync (CRDTs/OT) was too high-risk for MVP.
2.  **Use Case Clarity:** 95% of users just want *better notes*, not another collaboration tool to manage during a meeting.
3.  **Performance:** Browser-based audio handling + multi-user streaming introduced unacceptable latency.

**Current Architecture:**
- **Single Host:** One user records via browser.
- **Cloud/Local AI:** Heavy lifting by Groq (Transcription) and Gemini/Ollama (Reasoning).
- **Post-Hoc Sharing:** Notes are shared *after* generation, not co-typed in real-time.

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### ✅ Goals (Status Audit)

| Goal | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **G1: Enable shared meeting context** | ⚠️ Changed | Context is shared *post-meeting* or via screen share, not multi-device sync. |
| **G2: Eliminate "corporate amnesia"** | ✅ Working | VectorDB + History search is implemented. |
| **G3: Support on-site meetings** | ✅ Working | Room mic capture works well. |
| **G4: Provide instant catch-up** | ✅ Working | "Catch Me Up" feature is implemented and functional. |
| **G5: Enable cross-meeting continuity** | ✅ Working | Logic is implemented, but the **Linking UX is rough** and needs attention. |
| **G6: Automate action tracking** | ✅ Working | AI extraction is reliable. |
| **G7: Answer questions in real-time** | ⚠️ Unstable | "Ask AI" chat is functional but requires attention for reliability. |
| **G8: Secure Access & RBAC** | ✅ Working | Basic auth and domain restriction implemented. |
| **G9: Dynamic Chat-Based Notes** | ✅ Working | Chat interface for notes is active. |
| **G10: Personal API Key Support** | ✅ Working | User settings for API keys implemented. |

### ❌ Non-Goals (What We Will NOT Do)

**NG1**: Video/audio conferencing
We are NOT building Zoom/Teams/Meet. We augment meetings, not host them.

**NG2**: Calendar integration
No integration with Google Calendar, Outlook, etc. Meetings are started manually.

**NG3**: System audio capture (online meetings)
We focus on room microphone for on-site meetings. Capturing Zoom/Teams audio requires a desktop app (out of scope for MVP).

**NG4**: Mobile app or mobile browser support
Desktop/laptop browser only. All participants use laptops.



**NG6**: Enterprise deployment
Single-instance deployment. No multi-tenant, no cloud scale.

**NG7**: Meeting scheduling
No scheduling, invites, or recurring meeting management.

**NG8**: Offline mode
Requires network connection for real-time sync between participants.

**NG9: Real-time collaborative multi-user editing**
While AI-assisted editing and manual host edits are supported, full "Google Docs" style simultaneous multi-user typing is not the focus of the initial version.

**NG10**: Custom AI model training
Use existing models (Whisper, Ollama, Claude). No fine-tuning or custom model development.

## 5. Architecture Decision: Web vs. Desktop

### Context

The original Meetily project is built as a Tauri-based desktop application. This section documents the rationale for transitioning to a web-based architecture for the Meeting Co-Pilot fork.

### Decision

✅ **We will build Meeting Co-Pilot as a Web-based application (Next.js + FastAPI) rather than a desktop application (Tauri).**

### 5.1. Core Capability Analysis

**Verdict**: Web covers all required capabilities; desktop adds only non-goal features.

| Capability | Desktop (Tauri) | Web-based | Analysis |
|------------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| Room Mic Capture | ✅ Full support via Tauri APIs | ✅ Full support via getUserMedia() | TIE - Both support primary use case |
| System Audio Capture | ✅ Can capture Zoom/Teams audio | ❌ Requires browser extension | Desktop Win - But explicitly a **Non-Goal (NG3)** |
| Multi-participant | ⚠️ Requires install + coordination | ✅ Native web, URL-based joining | **Web Win** - Core requirement (FR1) |
| Real-time Sync | ⚠️ Desktop → Server → Desktop | ✅ Standard WebSocket pattern | **Web Win** - Simpler implementation |
| Cross-platform | ⚠️ Separate OS builds required | ✅ Single codebase | **Web Win** - Lower maintenance |

### 5.2. User Experience (UX) & Friction

**Verdict**: Web provides a dramatically lower barrier to entry for participants.

| Aspect | Desktop (Tauri) | Web-based | Impact |
|--------|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Joining Flow | ❌ Download → Install → Launch | ✅ Click URL → Join | **CRITICAL** - Meets <30s join target |
| IT/Security | ❌ May block .exe/.dmg files | ✅ No installation required | Significant - Enterprise readiness |
| Updates | ❌ User must manually update | ✅ Instant via deployment | Significant - Faster iteration |
| Onboarding | ❌ High (10–15 min) | ✅ Low (<30 seconds) | **CRITICAL** - Direct impact on adoption |

### 5.3. Development & Maintenance

**Estimated time impact**: Desktop adds 30–40% to development timeline (3–4 weeks → 5–6 weeks).

| Aspect | Desktop (Tauri) | Web-based | Timeline Impact |
|--------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Setup | ❌ Rust + Tauri + Node.js | ✅ Node.js only | -2 days |
| Learning Curve | ❌ Rust / Tauri APIs | ✅ Standard Web Stack | -3 to 5 days |
| Build/Deploy | ❌ Multi-OS builds + Code signing | ✅ Single cloud deployment | -2 days per release |
| Testing | ❌ Multiple OS versions | ✅ Browser-based testing | -3 days |

### 5.4. Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Desktop (Tauri) | Web-based | Mitigation |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Technical Risk | 🔴 HIGH - Less familiar stack | 🟢 LOW - Standard web stack | Use Web to reduce risk |
| Timeline Risk | 🔴 HIGH - 40% longer dev time | 🟢 LOW - Rapid development | Use Web to meet MVP deadline |
| Adoption Risk | 🔴 HIGH - Install friction | 🟢 LOW - Zero-friction joining | Use Web to maximize trials |
| Maintenance | 🟡 MED - OS updates / versions | 🟢 LOW - Single version | Use Web to reduce support |

### 5.5. Summary of Pros and Cons

**Web-based Application (Next.js)**

**Pros**:
- ✅ Zero Installation: Essential for the <30 second "Catch Me Up" requirement
- ✅ Instant Updates: Deploy bug fixes to all users simultaneously
- ✅ Collaboration Native: WebSockets and URL-sharing are native to the browser environment
- ✅ IT-Friendly: No security hurdles for company users

**Cons**:
- ❌ No System Audio: Cannot record internal Zoom audio (mitigated: NG3)
- ❌ Internet Dependent: Requires connection for session sync (mitigated: NG8)

**Desktop Application (Tauri)**

**Pros**:
- ✅ System Audio: Can record internal sound without extensions
- ✅ Offline Mode: Can process data locally

**Cons**:
- ❌ High Friction: High drop-off rate due to installation requirements
- ❌ Slower Dev: Rust/Tauri overhead extends the MVP timeline significantly

- Weekend breaks between major phases for testing/discovery
- Total timeline: 25 days vs optimistic 19 days = 6 days buffer (32%)

**Contingency Plan**:
- If Phase 1 takes longer: Can reduce Phase 5 scope (polish is flexible)
- If audio format issues: Switch to cloud transcription API temporarily
- If WebSocket issues: Can use polling as interim solution

**Critical Path**:
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 are **sequential dependencies**
Phase 4 and Phase 5 can be **deprioritized** if timeline pressure increases
