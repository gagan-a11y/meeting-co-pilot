## Introduction

Meeting Co-Pilot is a web-based collaborative meeting assistant forked from Meetily. It provides real-time transcription using Groq Whisper API with support for Hindi/English (Hinglish) mixed-language meetings.

**Key Differences from Meetily:**
- **Web-based**: Pure Next.js + FastAPI (no Tauri desktop app)
- **Real-time streaming**: Continuous PCM audio streaming with ~1-2s latency
- **Groq Whisper API**: Cloud-based transcription for faster processing
- **Collaborative**: Designed for multi-participant on-site meetings

## Features

- **Real-time Transcription:** Get a live transcript of your meeting as it happens (~1-2s latency).
- **Hinglish Support:** Auto language detection for Hindi/English code-switching.
- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Generate summaries of your meetings using Claude, Groq, or Ollama.
- **Web-Based:** Works on any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Open Source:** Meeting Co-Pilot is open source and free to use.

## System Architecture

Meeting Co-Pilot is a web-based application.
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) application with AudioWorklet for real-time audio capture.
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI server with WebSocket streaming, VAD, and Groq Whisper API.
- **Database**: SQLite for meeting storage.

## Installation
