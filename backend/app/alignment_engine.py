Alignment Engine for Speaker Diarization.

3-Tier Alignment Strategy:
1. Time Overlap (Primary) - Assign speaker based on time overlap
2. Word Density (Secondary) - Count words in speaker windows
3. Uncertain Fallback - Explicit UNCERTAIN state when confidence is low

This approach handles:
- Whisper timestamp drift
- Speaker changes mid-sentence
- Overlapping speech
- Low-confidence scenarios
