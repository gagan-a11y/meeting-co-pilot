## Running the App

### Development

To run the app in development mode:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
The app will be available at imports `http://localhost:3118` (or similar).

### Production Build

To build and start the production version:
```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```

## Backend Integration

This frontend requires the Python FastAPI backend to be running.
- Backend handles transcription, summarization, and storage.
- Ensure the backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Development

### Frontend (Next.js)
- The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- Source code is in the `src/` directory

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues on macOS
- If you encounter permission issues with scripts, make them executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x clean_run.sh clean_build.sh whisper-server-package/run-server.sh
  ```
- For microphone access issues, ensure the app has microphone permissions in System Preferences
- If the Whisper server fails to start, check if port 8178 is already in use

### Common Issues on Windows
- If you encounter build errors, ensure Visual Studio Build Tools are properly installed
- For audio capture issues, check Windows privacy settings for microphone access
- If the app fails to start, try running Command Prompt as administrator
